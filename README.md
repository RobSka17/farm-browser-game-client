# Farm Browser Game Client

This is a project inspired by the classic browser game Tribal Wars. As Tribal Wars implemented realtime gameplay by having players manage a settlement with timers for construction, unit recruitment and resource accumulation, this project aims to produce a similar experienced based around farming.

This client app is a TypeScript React app set up with Vite.

Running the app:
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

Running Jest tests:
`npm run test`
